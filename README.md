# Shooter's Rampage (Under Development)

Shooter's Rampage is a first person shooter game developed in Unity. </br> 

It takes place in an elevated area open from the ends and on the top. The game consists of movable enemies and stationary turrets. The game has a sci-fi setting which is apparent from the weapons, enemies and the setting where the game takes place.

To create more interesting, joyful and immersive experience I am developing this 3D space survival game with the virtual reality support.

I am going to use the unity game engine for designing and development of the game, further Iâ€™ll use the Google VR toolkit that is an open source plugin that will set up the environment for VR development.

I am going to use Google cardboard VR headset which is a low-cost viewer in which phones can be inserted to view VR apps along with that a gamepad is also present in the requirement for input. 

This game is under development but I have made the apk available for testing.

## Requirements

This game is compatible with Android devices.
